1. Due to time constraints I wasn't able to optimize the appliction using tools like: 
    a. Zustand for proper state management
    b. Axios for requests
    c. Tailwind CSS for a more comfortable css styling

2. Wanted to add a previous button in order clear the current fetched applictions and display the new applications dislayed

3. Wanted to Add a spinner and track load state to make the UX much better

4. Wanted to Handle errors better for both the componets and the api calls
